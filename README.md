# ClubbyCloset_project

ClubbyCloset is a project developed by Acitelli Giacomo, Del Citto Giulia, Di Pietro Giorgia, presented for Human-Computer Interactions elective from the M.Sc. in Eng. in Computer Science at "La Sapienza" University of Rome .
ClubbyCloset is a mobile application that allows you to find ideas and share advice about outfits to be worn in different circumstances.
Differently from other existing and established apps, we want to focus more on the context of the event and on the personâ€™s style and characteristics than on the brand or on who recommends it (influencers typically).

The project appliccation has been developed in android studio.
To execute the code you have to download AndroidStudio (https://developer.android.com/studio) and open the downloaded code, the application can run on physical device or using the simulator.
